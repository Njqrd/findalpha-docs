# Time Period Selector

FindAlpha provides a **unified time period selector** that allows users to analyze fund performance over consistent time horizons. This makes it easy to compare funds across borders and asset classes using standardized timeframes.

### Where to Find It

The **time selector button** is located in the top right corner of the screen—next to the currency selector. Clicking this button opens a dropdown menu with the following options:

- **1Y** – Past 1 Year  
- **3Y** – Past 3 Years  
- **5Y** – Past 5 Years  
- **10Y** – Past 10 Years

Once a time period is selected, the entire platform updates to reflect return data and calculated metrics over the chosen horizon. This applies across all interactive components, including return charts, drawdown analysis, radar profiles, comparison tables, and distribution visuals.

### Why It Matters

Standardizing timeframes enables meaningful performance comparisons, even between funds launched in different regions or quoted in different currencies. Users can evaluate risk-adjusted returns, consistency, and behavior over time with confidence.

> Note: Funds with insufficient history for the selected period are excluded from certain comparisons to ensure data integrity.
