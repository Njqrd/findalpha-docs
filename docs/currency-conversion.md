# Currency Selector


To make cross-border ETF and fund comparisons seamless, FindAlpha.io includes a **unifying currency selector**. This ensures that all performance metrics and comparisons are displayed in a **single, consistent currency**, regardless of the fund’s native denomination.

### Where to Find It

At the **top right corner** of the screen, you’ll find a floating button displaying the currently selected currency (e.g. **$, €, £, or R**). Clicking this opens a dropdown menu with four available options:

- **$ USD** – United States Dollar  
- **€ EUR** – Euro  
- **£ GBP** – British Pound  
- **R ZAR** – South African Rand

This selector updates the entire platform to reflect your chosen currency—across all charts, tables, and metrics.

### How Currency Conversion Works

All currency conversions are processed using the **US Dollar (USD) as a base currency** to ensure consistency and precision.

For example:  
If a fund’s native currency is **GBP** and you’ve selected **EUR** as your preferred display currency, the platform performs a two-step conversion:  
**GBP → USD → EUR**

This approach standardizes all currency transitions and supports accurate, apples-to-apples comparisons across regions and fund types.

> Note: Exchange rates are refreshed regularly to ensure up-to-date performance comparisons across timeframes and benchmarks.
