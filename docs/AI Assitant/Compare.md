# Fund Comparison Agent Overview
The Fund Comparison Agent is a high-level investment analysis tool designed for head-to-head comparison of multiple funds across a unified time horizon and currency base. It serves investors, analysts, and advisors seeking to evaluate 2–6 funds in a structured, side-by-side format, delivering concise and data-driven conclusions.

## What It Does
The agent compares key quantitative performance metrics — including return, volatility, drawdown, and risk-adjusted measures — across multiple funds using standardized inputs. It then synthesizes these results into an executive summary and detailed breakdown for each fund, making it easy to identify strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases.

Unlike single-fund analysis tools, this agent focuses exclusively on comparative insights, determining which fund stands out and why. It ensures all metrics are aligned to the largest common time window (e.g., 5y, 10y) and normalized into the same base currency (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP) for true apples-to-apples analysis.

## Output Structure
*Analysis Parameters*: Currency, Time Period, Category, and Confidence level.

*Executive Summary*: Concise, high-level interpretation of the comparison — including a clear winner and the trade-off between return and risk.
