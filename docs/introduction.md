    <p>Analyzing and comparing investment funds across different countries presents significant challenges. The data is often fragmented across various sources, including PDFs, custodian reports, and disparate APIs. This lack of uniformity leads to several critical issues that make the traditional approach to global fund analysis a manual, error-prone, and unscalable process, ill-suited for the demands of modern, data-driven investment strategies.</p>
