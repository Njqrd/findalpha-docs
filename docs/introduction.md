## The Problem: Cross-Border Fund Comparison Is Broken

When I tried answering what seemed like simple questions about fund performance across borders, I was quickly overwhelmed by how fragmented and opaque the process really was.

I spent countless hours manually pulling data from a patchwork of sources — PDFs, Excel sheets from custodians, scattered APIs — just to get the raw inputs needed to begin any sort of analysis.

Then came the deeper issues:

- Currency fluctuations that distorted performance.
- Non-standardized metrics and inconsistent benchmarks between funds.
- Different time horizons across regions.
- And a lack of intuitive visual tools to make sense of it all.

It became clear: the traditional process is manual, error-prone, non-scalable, and not built for modern investors — let alone for AI-driven analysis or decision-making.

## The Solution: FindAlpha.io — Designed for Intelligent, Cross-Border Fund Comparison

To solve these frustrations, I built FindAlpha.io, a platform designed to bring structure, transparency, and intelligence to global fund comparison. Here's how:

- **70+ Global Funds, One Unified Framework**: Access a curated, growing set of over 70 global ETFs and funds — all processed through a single, standardized analytical pipeline for reliable, head-to-head comparison.
- **Unified Currency Basis**: All performance metrics are normalized to a single currency, stripping out FX noise and revealing the true underlying performance of each fund.
- **Customizable Benchmarks**: Users can adjust benchmarks to match their strategy or risk appetite, enabling personalized and relevant alpha and beta insights across regions.
- **Standardized Risk & Return Metrics**: FindAlpha uses consistent methodology for Sharpe, Sortino, alpha, and beta calculations, ensuring comparisons are fair and apples-to-apples — regardless of domicile or benchmark idiosyncrasies.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Built with AI at its core, the platform highlights opportunities, anomalies, and trends across datasets — making it easier to generate actionable insights rather than just raw numbers.
- **Advanced Visual Analytics**: Complex data is transformed into clear, interactive visuals, helping investors see patterns, compare strategies, and make confident decisions — fast.

This isn’t just automation — it's intelligent structuring of investment data, built for a world where information speed, clarity, and personalization define success.
