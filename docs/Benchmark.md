FindAlpha.io includes a powerful **benchmark builder** that allows users to standardize comparisons by selecting a unified benchmark composed of both a stock index and a bond index. This benchmark is then used for return comparisons and proprietary metric calculations such as **Beta**, and **Alpha**.

### How It Works

Each benchmark is a **two-part composite** made up of:

- **One equity index** (representing stock market exposure)
- **One bond index** (representing fixed income exposure)

Users can choose from three predefined regional combinations:

| Benchmark | Stock Index | Bond Index |
|:---------|:----------|:----------|
| **World** | MSCI World | FTSE World Government Bond Index |
| **US** | S&P 500 | US Government Bonds |
| **UK** | FTSE 100 | FTSE UK Government Bonds |  

### Why It Matters

A consistent benchmark enables meaningful performance attribution and comparison across all funds, regardless of origin. Once selected, the benchmark is used throughout the platform for:

- **Alpha** and **Beta** calculations  
- **Relative return** and **drawdown comparisons**  
- **Radar chart normalization**  
- **Distribution and scatter chart baselines**

> Note: All benchmarks are currency-adjusted according to the user's selected display currency to ensure cross-border comparability.

### Where to find the benchmark builder

The benchmark builder can be found by clicking the menu on the top left and then the second button (labeled Benchmark Builder)
