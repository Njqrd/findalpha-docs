# Distribution

## Distribution Comparison

This visual stacks or overlays **multiple performance distributions**, showing how funds differ in return behavior. Unlike the frequency chart (which focuses on one fund at a time), this one enables **comparative distribution analysis** between funds and their benchmark.

Great for identifying:

- Whether a fund takes more or less risk  
- Asymmetry in return profiles  
- Consistency in monthly outcomes
