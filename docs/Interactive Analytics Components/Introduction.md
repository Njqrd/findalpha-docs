 ## Interactive Analytical Components

FindAlpha.io includes a suite of interactive charts and comparison tools designed to give users a deep, intuitive understanding of ETF and fund behavior. These tools are dynamically updated based on the selected currency, benchmark, and time period.

### Radar Chart (Risk & Return Profile)

The **Radar Chart** visualizes a fund's multi-dimensional performance metrics in a single glance. It compares key attributes between one or more funds and the selected benchmark.

Metrics include:

- Rate of Return  
- R/R Ratio (Return/Risk)  
- Sharpe Ratio  
- Sortino Ratio  
- Alpha  
- Volatility  
- Beta  
- Drawdown  

Each axis is normalized so that comparisons are scale-independent. This chart is ideal for understanding **risk-adjusted return profiles** and identifying strengths or weaknesses in performance.

### Simulated Return Chart (Growth of €10,000)

This chart simulates how an investment of €10,000 (or the equivalent in your selected currency) would have grown over time in:

- Each selected fund  
- The unified benchmark

It clearly highlights:

- **Relative outperformance/underperformance**  
- **Drawdown periods**  
- **Time under water**  
- **Volatility and compounding effects**

Interactive overlays show time spans and percentage differences at various points, making the chart a powerful visual for communicating investment trajectory.

### Metric Cards

Each fund is accompanied by a set of **individual metric cards**, providing numerical values for:

- Total Return  
- Volatility  
- Sharpe/Sortino Ratios  
- Max Drawdown  
- Alpha, Beta  
- Recovery Time  
- Other proprietary ratios

Hovering over any metric reveals a **tooltip** that explains the calculation and its significance.

### Frequency Distribution

This chart shows the **distribution of monthly returns** for the selected fund(s) and the benchmark. It helps users understand the **volatility** and **consistency** of returns by visualizing how often returns fall within specific ranges.

Useful for spotting:

- Skewness  
- Fat tails (risk of extreme events)  
- Mean reversion tendencies  

---

### Scatter Plot (Risk vs Return)

The scatter chart maps each fund's **annualized return** (X-axis) against its **volatility** (Y-axis), allowing for clear identification of risk/return trade-offs.

Each point represents a fund, and the benchmark is included as a reference point. Use this chart to visually segment funds into:

- High-risk, high-return  
- Conservative/defensive  
- Inefficient (lower return for higher risk)

---

### Distribution Comparison

This visual stacks or overlays **multiple performance distributions**, showing how funds differ in return behavior. Unlike the frequency chart (which focuses on one fund at a time), this one enables **comparative distribution analysis** between funds and their benchmark.

Great for identifying:

- Whether a fund takes more or less risk  
- Asymmetry in return profiles  
- Consistency in monthly outcomes

---

All charts are interactive, fully responsive, and updated in real time based on user selections. Combined, these tools give investors a robust visual understanding of fund behavior—going far beyond what standard return tables provide.
