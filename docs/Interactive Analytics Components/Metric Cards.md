# Metric Cards

The **Metric Cards** section gives you a quick, at-a-glance comparison of a fund's key performance indicators. Each card represents a specific metric and uses a bar chart to visualize the fund's performance against a benchmark and other references.

This component is designed for rapid analysis and direct comparison.

## Understanding the Bars

Each metric card can display several bars, with each color representing a different entity:

* **Selected (Green/Purple Bar):** This shows the metrics for the primary fund you are analyzing. You can set this by **clicking** on a fund in a table or by **clicking** a dot on the Scatter Plot.
* **Hover (White Bar):** This bar appears when you **hover your mouse** over a different fund or a dot on the Scatter Plot. It allows for quick, temporary comparisons without losing your main selection.
* **Benchmark:** This is a pre-defined market benchmark (e.g., S&P 500) that serves as a standard for comparison.
* **RBTC:** This represents another fixed reference point for comparison.

## Available Metrics

The dashboard displays the following key performance metrics:

* **Rate Of Return:** The net gain or loss of an investment over time, shown as a percentage.
* **R/R Ratio:** The Reward-to-Risk ratio, which compares the potential profit of a trade to its potential loss.
* **Sharpe Ratio:** Measures risk-adjusted return. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better performance for the amount of risk taken.

* **Sortino Ratio:** A variation of the Sharpe ratio that only penalizes for downside volatility, offering a different view of risk-adjusted returns.
* **Alpha:** The excess return of an investment relative to a benchmark index. Positive alpha means the fund outperformed its benchmark.
* **Volatility:** The standard deviation of an asset's returns, representing its price fluctuation and risk level.
* **Beta:** Measures an asset's volatility relative to the overall market. A beta {'>'} 1 means it's more volatile than the market, and a beta {'<'} 1 means it is less volatile.
* **Drawdown:** The maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough of a portfolio, indicating downside risk over a specific period.
