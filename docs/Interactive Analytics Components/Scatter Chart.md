# Scatter Plot

The **Scatter Plot** is a powerful, interactive tool for visualizing the relationship between any two performance metrics. Each dot on the plot represents a single fund, allowing you to easily identify trends, outliers, and clusters within a group of assets.

## Key Features

### Customizable Axes

The core strength of the Scatter Plot is its flexibility. You can select any of the available performance metrics for the **X-Axis** and **Y-Axis** using the dropdown menus at the top of the chart.

This allows you to create custom analytical views to uncover insights. For example:
* Plot **Volatility** vs. **Annualized Return** to analyze risk/return profiles.
* Plot **Beta** vs. **Alpha** to see which funds generate returns independent of market movements.

### Interactive Data Points

The plot is fully integrated with the **Metric Cards** for a seamless analytical workflow. Interacting with the dots on the plot will dynamically update the information displayed elsewhere.

* **Hovering (White Dot):** When you **hover your mouse** over any dot, it will be highlighted in **white**. The **Hover (White Bar)** in the Metric Cards section will instantly update to show the metrics for that specific fund. This is perfect for quick comparisons.

* **Clicking (Green Dot):** When you **click** on any dot, it becomes the **Selected** fund and is highlighted in **green**. This action updates the **Selected (Green/Purple Bar)** in the Metric Cards, making that fund the primary subject of your analysis until you select another.
